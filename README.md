## Gameplay

Each player is shown two cards/boxes each containing 8 individual items. One item is common in both the cards and the goal is to choose the common item.

If the common item is clicked, a new card replaces the older card and the common item in the new pair of cards has to be chosen.

Each player gets 20 cards and the first one to go through his/her set of cards wins.
